In this blog, I would like to introduce our new open-source python library called: PyMM (Python Memory Management).
This python library makes it easy for a Python developer to use Persistent Memory (e.g., Intel Optane Non-Volatile DIMMs). 
The approach brings persistent memory to existing data types, and we started with NumPy arrays and PyTorch tensors since
they are both popular data types among data science.

## Motivation 
Persistent Memory in's early age and didn't reach its full potential. Most of the research and the adoptions for Optane are
in two dimensions, databases and storage systems use the persistent mode for fault tolerance, fast recovery, and reduced battery cost.
For the memory mode, the usage is by data science that needs enormous memory with static data.
